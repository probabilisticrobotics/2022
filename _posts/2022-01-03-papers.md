We cordially invite researchers to submit short papers. We accept original papers, as well as in-review or accepted manuscripts. Submitted contributions can describe work in progress, preliminary results, novel concepts, or industrial applications.

All manuscripts are limited to 4+n pages (i.e., additional pages over 4 are ONLY allowed for references), should use the IEEE standard two-column conference format (paper template available on the IEEE IROS 2022 website).

All original submissions will be peer-reviewed in single-blind manner. Submissions will be selected by workshop organizers based on the reviews, their originality, relevance to the workshop topics, contributions, technical clarity, and presentation. All accepted manuscripts will be presented as posters during the workshop. **Two** top contributions will be selected for 10-minute oral presentations at spotlight sessions. Accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website. For other questions you can contact us via email: probabilistic_robotics@dlr.de.
